### Lecture 9, Functional Dependency
`X->Y`, X is determinant set, Y is dependent set
  - At most one value of Y for any X
  - eg. a supervisor can only have 1 specialization, but many supervisor can specialize at the same thing
  - If Y is a subset of X, then it is trivial
  - We care about non-trivial ones
    - given as constraints
  - Concept of a Key in a table
    - `primary key -> all attr.`
  - Any set of attribute that determines whole tuple -> **SuperKey**
  - Minimal set that determines entire tuple is **candidate key**
    - multiple, choose one as primary key

- Reflexivity, Augmentation and Transitivity are sound and complete

- Attribute Set
  - $X^+$ -> set of attr that can be functionally determined by X under F
  - include itself, and what it can determine
  - Algo: Check one level at a time
  - Can be used to check for super key

Redundancy: if can be inferred, then remove!

Canonical Order
- no redundancy, every other set would be the same
- left side of each functional dependency is unique (no duplicate left side!)
- find and replace, use union rule or find extraneous ones

## Lecture 10, cont.

Prime Attribute - part of any candidate key (any set that minimally determines hole tuple)

Partial: VZ -> A, Z->A is partial

Transitive: X->Y, X->A Y->A is transitive

Normalization: reduce redundancy, should be lossless
- basically decomposition

Normal form does not mean good design!

Design guidelines:
1. Clear Semantics for Attributes
  - Design so its easy to define a schema meaning, attrs should be related
  - Easy to explain schema = good!
2. Minimize Use of Null Values
  - If not relatable, there will be a bunch of null value, which should be avoided
3. Minimize Redundancy
  - lessen space needed
4. Lossless Decomp
  - The common attribute between the decomposed relations must be a superkey for R<sub>1</sub> or R<sub>2</sub>
  - lossless join back to initial relation
5. Preserve Functional Dependencies
  - if any gets lost, then things are harder to enforce
  - the decomp should allow for FD checks to persist



First Normal Form: all attributes are atomic
- no multi valued or composite attributes
- Relation Schema are 1NF by default

Second Normal Form: non-prime attributes are fully functionally dependent on every candidate key.
- subset of candidate key cannot determine a non-prime attribute
- **No partial dependency**, where a column can deend on one of the primary keys
  - if {X, Y} are candidate keys, X -> A where X is a proper subset and A is not a prime attribute would fail it
  - if transitive (A->B where A, B are both non-prime, then its still fine)
- X -> A, X is not proper subset (missing at least 1 from whole set) or A is prime

Proper subset iff every element but at least one in the subset


Third Normal Form: every non-prime attribute of R is non-transitively dependent on every candidate key of R
- basically, the all FD of X -> A, X is super key or A is prime
  - if X ->A, X must be a superkey of a schema, or A must be a part of candidate keys

Algo:
- create a relation for each FD
- if no schema has a candidate key for R (so find the candidate key!)
- choose an candidate key, and add that relation

Redundancy still exist in 3F, in opposite direction

First Normal Form:  The information is stored in a relational table and each column contains atomic values, and there are not repeating groups of columns.

Second Normal Form: The table is in first normal form and all the columns depend on the tableâ€™s primary key.

Third Normal Form: the table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key

BCNF - Boyce-Codd
- Basically, the LHS **has** to be a super-key, no extraneous on RHS
- No redundancy
- has to be 3NF first
- BEST NORMAL FORM
- always a lossless conversion
- All FD may *not* bre preserved
- Checking F is sufficient (no need for F+), check if the super key is the same
  - for derived schemas, check F+


Algorithm
- start with initial schema
- for each R in the schemas,  if X->Y violate BCNF,
  - take away table, add schema of old table with out Y and add (X, Y) -> X is now a candidate key

to see if something is BCNF using $F$ is fine, for actual decomposition, need $F^+$

Sometimes updating BCNF is inefficient
- you can go back to 3NF, which cost more space
- you can use a materialized view, just less prone to errors

Test: 
- For every attribute in $R_i$, check if $X^+$ include no attribute of $R_i-X$ or all attributes of $R_i$
